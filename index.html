      I do be having a sudden hype about him tho.
      Plagg, ma boi, lovesss cheese.
      It's all that he eats for his daily diet.
      Oh well he is the Kuami of the cat miraculous.
      The holder of the cat miraculous is <a href="https://miraculousladybug.fandom.com/wiki/Adrien_Agreste">Adrien</a>.
      Short note on Adrien : he is a blind boy, well he is actually <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f8/6d/21/f86d216266b9df2a70cf08483babe0be.jpg">colour blind</a>😒.

  <h2>BUT WHY DIRTY SOCKS IS AWESOME?</h2>
    <img src="images/sockplagg.png" alt="plagg made of socks">
  <ol>
    <li>Well point num 1, it helped Plagg to cope with hunger when tempted with cheese.</li>
    <li> Number two when Plagg runs out of cheese (<em>which please let him never</em>),
      he can cope with it with this wonderful source of fragrance.
      Well it's odour... but its fragrance✨for Plagg.</li>
